# Healthcare-Review-Analysis
In healthcare, patient experience is a critical factor in assessing hospital quality. I conducted an in-depth text analysis on medical reviews from 14 hospitals specializing in chronic diseases using web scraping, NLP, and predictive modeling in R. 


Hereâ€™s what I uncovered:

ðŸ”¹ Web Scraping & Data Collection â€“ Automated retrieval of hospital reviews from Healthgrades.com, structuring data for analysis 

ðŸ”¹ Text Preprocessing & Sentiment Analysis â€“ Removed 50+ medical-related stop-words, classified sentiment using Bing & Afinn lexicons, and found that 75% of reviews were positive 

ðŸ”¹ Data Visualization â€“ Created word clouds, bar charts, and facet plots to highlight sentiment trends 

ðŸ”¹ Topic Modeling (LDA) â€“ Extracted 5 key topics, revealing appointment scheduling and hospital atmosphere as top concerns 

ðŸ”¹ Predictive Sentiment Modeling â€“ Built a logistic regression model to forecast sentiment trends, identifying hospitals likely to maintain high patient 


Key Finding? Brigham and Women's Hospital showed the highest negative sentiment trend, while New York-Presbyterian and Stanford Health Care ranked highest in predicted satisfaction scores.


This project showcases data science applications in healthcare, revealing how patient feedback can predict future sentiment trends and aid informed decision-making.
